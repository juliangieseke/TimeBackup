This Script is provided AS IS! Please only use if you know what you're doing…


## About this Script
This script provides a simple implementation of a File History Snapshot like Backup. Its functionality is highly inspired by Apple Time Machine and Synology Time Backup/Hyper Backup. Like Time Backup and Time Machine, it uses a file based approach with hardlinks instead of a Database file like Hyper Backup and many other Backup Solutions do.

## Warning
**This Script isnt tested very well yet (if at all) and most of the code is very bad, so use at your own Risk and dont blame me if something goes wrong.**


## Changelog

…blame tb.sh pls :)
